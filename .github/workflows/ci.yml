    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Build the Docker image for the Django application
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build ./backend -t django-app:${{ github.sha }}

      # (Optional but good) Step 3: Run basic tests inside the container
      # We will add this later. For now, just building is enough for a fresher.
